# Programming Environments Classwork
A minimal C# project developed during the "Programming Environments" classes in Techical Univeristy - Sofia, Bulgaria.

## Prerequests (Linux)

The project was initially built in **Linux** environment (Ubuntu) and developed using **Visual Studio Code** with [_.NET SDK version 6_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) instead of the tranditional way under Windows with Visual Studio.

>  _I know, I know, but I prefer working on Linux rather than on Windows, even when it comes to .NET and C#. I do not need to wait Visual Studio with all it's bloatware to finish loading when I'm going to develop a single console app for classwork purpouses._ :smile:

Tested and working on **WSL2** with no differences.

If you are interested in developing basic .NET apps under Linux, or if you are just curious how it is done, check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/IvoKara/f9a61afe9efaa13f1203ec089b9df60c).
