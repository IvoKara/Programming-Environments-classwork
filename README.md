A minimal C# project developed during the "Programming Environments" classes in Techical Univeristy - Sofia, Bulgaria.

The project was initially built in **Linux** environment (Ubuntu) and developed using **Visual Studio Code** with _.NET SDK version 6_ instead of the tranditional way under Windows with Visual Studio.

Tested and working on **WSL2** with no differences.
